libelf
-------
Library for opening and parsing ELF binaries with no dependencies!
Support for:
  + Parsing 64 and 32 bit ELF headers
  + Parsing program headers (64-bit, 32-bit)
  + Parsing section headers (64-bit, 32-bit)
  + String and symbol table support

To-Do:
  + Relocation entry support
  + Dynamic tag support
  + Note support

Note
-----
All code is written following the elf(5) man page and im working on developing
a readelf clone to demonstrate, compare and verify functionality. For now tho
im just inspecting the data structures with GDB

Usage
------
To open an ELF file you only need to use the following function:
  
  ELF *elf_open(char *filepath)

This function will open and read the binary data within an ELF file
and parse its data structures into an ELF structure (defined in libelf.h)

On success, elf_open() returns a pointer to an ELF structure (again, libelf.h), 
on error it will return NULL and write an error message to STDERR although this
is subject to change in the future.

ELF structure:

  typedef struct{
    elf_hdr *hdr;
    program_hdr **phdrs;
    section_hdr **shdrs;
    char *shstrtab;
    char *strtab;
    sym **symtab;
    char *fdata;
    off_t fdata_size;
    uint64_t unused;
  } ELF

libelf functionality
---------------------
alot of libelf's code is hidden behind elf_open(), as i feel as though its too
risky to expose an interface to these functions by default and rather have open_elf()
do any necessary sanity checks before parsing data structures by calling said functionality.
